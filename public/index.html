          <p class="details"><em>Cooking</em> is one of my favorite ways to pass the time on 'lazy days.' Lately, I've been making quicker meals rather than the more elaborate ideas I used to do.<br>
          I've always loved <em>listening to music.</em> You can bet that when I'm at home since being in quarantine I love music. Constantly. Some of my favorites are Princess Nokia, Arctic Monkeys, Amy Winehouse, Kari Faux, Kali Uchis, La Favi, Rahim Al Haj, Dounia, Grimes before Elon, xxyyxx, bonobo, Fleetwood Mac, Cardi B (Gangsta B, both volumes), and then the obvious of our generation: Frank Ocean, Solange, toro y moi... The list really does go on.<br>
          My soul and passion lies in <em>reading and writing.</em> When I was in middle school, I always won the personal pizzas for reading x amount every quarter. Those were simpler time, just showing up to Pizza Hut with my personal pan coupon... Sigh. I have been working on my first fictional novel in my professsional writing career for several months now. It's my main motivation for starting web dev. I want to be able to do the whole vacation for a month thing. I would write the whole time.<br>
          Taking nature walks: exploring parks is one of my favorite ways to get to know a city. I've been blessed to travel and live in a few different cities over my life. Melbourne Australia, Washington, D.C, Los Angeles... I learned more about myself and the world every time I traveled freely. That's one thing I'll really miss about pre-COVID-19.<br>
          Learning new <em>languages</em> is a huge part of my life. Right now I'm on Mandarin Chinese through an app that the Chicago Public Library's online resources pointed me to. English is my native language but I'm getting up there in Spanish too.</p>
